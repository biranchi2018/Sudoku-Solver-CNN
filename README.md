# Sudoku-Solver-CNN

I am solving the sudoku puzzle using convolutions neural network.

This project contains following files:

-  `data_preprocess.py`:  prepare training and testing data
-  `model.py`:  neural network implementation
-  `sudoku.ipynb` :  jupyter notebook for running and testing the code
-  `sudoku.model`:  saved model

To run this project, you can run `sudoku.ipynb` notebook. Following is a snippet showing network solving the sudoku.
